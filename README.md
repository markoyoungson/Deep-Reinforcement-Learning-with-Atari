# Deep-Reinforcmenet-Learning-with-Atari

Hey everyone!
Here I will be showing all my code for my project on creating an Agent to play atari games.










If you want a more in depth break down of the code and reasoning behind it check out my [article](https://mark-youngson5.medium.com/so-you-want-to-play-atari-games-e9252762a142) I wrote on it!
